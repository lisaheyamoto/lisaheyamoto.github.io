Once upon a time, there was a unicorn named Ken. He liked to eat watermelon and drink non-alcoholic beer.
</p>
<p>
One day, Ken was walking through the forest when he came upon a gnome named Larry. Larry happened to have a six-pack of O'Douls, so Ken decided to stop and introduce himself.

	Larry very generously decided to share his non-alcoholic beer with Ken, and the two proceeded to polish off the entire six-pack.

	<p>
	But Larry didn't know that the beer was non-alcoholic and he started to act a little funny. This confused Ken, and started to make him think that Larry was not as cool as he'd supposed.
